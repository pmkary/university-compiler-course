## Initial Note

To prove the originality of the work I have taken these measures:

- All the codes within this document (except of the Assembly material) are written in [KaryScript Language](https://github.com/pmkary/KaryScript). This is a language made by me and __the only person that has a working compiler is also me__ the even better part is that __the only person who knows how to code in KaryScript is also only me__. This effectively reduces the population of developers who I can stole their work to only one person.

- This document is written in Markdown using a proprietary templating theme and processor of mine in which I can not share details however the main code of this document is available [here on GitHub]() with __commit history signed by me__ so one can hardly say anything here is stolen or copied.

## Part I

### I.I. Compare some Programming Languages

- Haskell: Is a __functional only__ programming language that has a rich type system (supporting union types, advance type inference, and static type checking)
